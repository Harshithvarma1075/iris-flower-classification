Loading the Dataset: Load the dataset from Kaggle and ensure column names are correctly formatted.
Preprocessing: Check for missing values and define feature columns and target column.
Feature and Target Definition: Split the data into features and target variables.
Splitting the Data: Use train_test_split to create training and testing datasets.
Standardizing Features: Apply StandardScaler to standardize features.
Training and Evaluation: Train a RandomForestClassifier and evaluate its performance.
Making Predictions: Ensure the example input matches the features used during training. Scale the example input using the same scaler used for training data.
By following these steps, you can train a model using the Iris dataset from Kaggle and make accurate predictions without encountering errors related to feature mismatch. Adjust the example input as needed to ensure it matches the features used for training.
